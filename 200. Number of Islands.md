# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.



**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        // base case 
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0){
            return 0;
        }

        int row = grid.length;
        int col = grid[0].length;

        int[][] visited = new int[row][col]; // 0 false 1 true

        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++){
                if (grid[i][j] == '1' && visited[i][j] == 0){
                    result++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j, visited); // 
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int x, int y, int[][] visited){
        int row = grid.length;
        int col = grid[0].length;

        if (x < 0 || x >= row || y < 0 || y >= col || grid[x][y] == '0' || visited[x][y] == 1){
            return;
        }

        visited[x][y] = 1;

        dfs(grid, x + 1, y, visited);
        dfs(grid, x-1, y, visited);
        dfs(grid, x, y+1, visited);
        dfs(grid, x, y-1, visited);
    }
}


// TC: O(m*n)
// SC: O(m*n)
```
