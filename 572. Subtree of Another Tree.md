# [572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of` subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./572. Subtree of Another Tree/subtree1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![img](./572. Subtree of Another Tree/subtree2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the `root` tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
- The number of nodes in the `subRoot` tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `-104 <= root.val <= 104`
- `-104 <= subRoot.val <= 104`



**Solution:**

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubtree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot) {
        if (root == null){
            return false;
        }

        if (subRoot == null){
            return true;
        }

        if (isSameTree(root, subRoot)){
            return true;
        }

        return isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);

    }

    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot){
        if (root == null && subRoot == null){
            return true;
        }

        if (root == null && subRoot != null){
            return false;
        }

        if (root != null && subRoot == null){
            return false;
        }

        if (root.val != subRoot.val){
            return false;
        }

        return isSameTree(root.left, subRoot.left) && isSameTree(root.right, subRoot.right);
    }
}

//TC:O(n*m)
//SC:O(n+m)
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity: O*(*MN). For every N `node` in the tree, we check if the tree rooted at `node` is identical to `subRoot`. This check takes O(M)time, where M is the number of nodes in `subRoot`. Hence, the overall time complexity is O(MN).

- Space complexity: O(M+N).

  There will be at most N recursive call to `dfs` ( or `isSubtree`). Now, each of these calls will have M recursive calls to `isIdentical`. Before calling `isIdentical`, our call stack has at most O(N) elements and might increase to O(N+M) during the call. After calling `isIdentical`, it will be back to at most O(N) since all elements made by `isIdentical` are popped out. Hence, the maximum number of elements in the call stack will be M+N.
