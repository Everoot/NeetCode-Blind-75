# [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        int n = intervals.length;
        if (n <= 1){
            return 0;
        }

        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a,b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        int prev = 0;
        int count = 1; // not overlap
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            if (intervals[prev][1] <= intervals[i][0]){
                prev = i;
                count++;
            }
        }


        return n - count;
    }
}

// 1

// [1, 11] p
// [2, 12]
// [11, 22]
// [1,10]

// TC: O(nlogn)
// SC: O(1)
```
